# GaussianSplattingProject
This is my first attempt to Gaussian Splatting!
For this project, we attempt to create a 3D model of 2 objects (a ten-peso coin and a small bone fragment of a rodent). Using OpenSplat, a free and open source implementation of 3D gaussian splatting written in C++, we were able to generate a scene file for each object. The source codes and procedures on how to implement OpenSplat can be found in https://github.com/pierotofy/OpenSplat.
